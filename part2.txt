(1) What did you end up doing?


(2) What was hard?


(3) What did you learn?


(4) What should your score be (out of 100)?


(5) Give me clear and concise instruction that would help me:

    (a) run your code and see that it worked
    To compile, on Ubuntu you would need the packages "libsdl2-dev" and "libsdl2-ttf-dev".

    (b) browse your code
